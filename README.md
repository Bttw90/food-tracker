# Fodd Tracker
Food Tracker is a simple diary application designed to track your daily food intake. It allows you to add individual ingredients, specify their quantities, and calculates the calories and macronutrients of your meals. You can also save your meals for future reference.

The application has been developed using Python and utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the SQLite3 module for storing meal data. Additionally, an executable file has been created using PyInstaller, enabling non-technical users to easily download and utilize the program.

I opted to let the user register (for free) on the API site used to obtain the key needed for the software to work properly, since free registration allows a limited number of calls.

### Usage
To use the Food Tracker application, follow the steps below:
- Download the file inside the "dist" folder.
- Double-click the executable file to launch the Food Tracker application.
- Click on the "API Key" button in the upper right corner to enter the API key or receive a new one by following the instructions, after that save the key by pressing the "Save Key" button.
- Return to the main application window and start adding ingredients by clicking on the "Add Food" button.
- Enter the name of the ingredient, specify the quantity, and click "Calculate" to see the sum of calories and macronutrients of your meals.
- If desired, click the "Save" button to store the meal for future reference. The program will save to the selected day, viewable at the top, by default if not changed it will be today's date.
- To change the selected day simply click on the button on top where the date is represented, after which select the desired date and click the "Select" button, which will load the choosen day with the various meals if previously saved.

### Note about Antivirus Software
Please be aware that some antivirus programs may flag the executable file generated by PyInstaller as potentially harmful. This is a common behavior, especially with lesser-known executables or those created by custom scripts. Rest assured that the Food Tracker application is completely safe to use and does not contain any malicious code.

If your antivirus software raises a warning, you can safely ignore it and proceed with running the Food Tracker application. In case you encounter any issues related to antivirus warnings, consider adding the application to your antivirus software's exclusion list to prevent any future alerts.
